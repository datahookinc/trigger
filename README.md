Trigger is a data-oriented state management library developed for React and TypeScript. Trigger is lightweight, with 0 dependencies, and is designed to optimize the developer experience for working with data in your application.

Trigger borrows philosophies and design patterns from database management (e.g., INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE, triggers, transactions, etc.) and spreadsheets; however, it also borrows design patterns from other popular React state management systems to maximize your productivity.
